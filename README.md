## Who is this for?
#### Modern Desktop Warriors
If you multitask a lot and don't always have a lot of time to sink into a full C64 play session, this is for you.  Turn on the C64, load the UI, click random, and you get instant gratification for a quick play session.

#### Kids
Kids have short attention spans.  The randomization features are invaluable here and will keep them engaged for much longer.

#### Chiptune Lovers 
This is the retro jukebox you've been looking for.  The continuous playing capability turns your 8-bit machine into a streaming service so can enjoy tunes hands free while you do other things.  DeepSID rules, but it's not hardware and it does sound different. :)

#### Purists 
You may think this lacks the charm of a pure C64 experience...sure.  I can't argue with that. But I challenge you to give it a shot.  Just try SID music player while you're busy doing other things.  It also has plenty of file transfer utility to reduce the SD card / USB juggling operation.  

## The Project Story
I am a late bloomer commodore 64 nerd.  I found a C64 at an auction and thought, hey, maybe I can find a way to control one of these with MIDI to make some music.  I started researching ways to get some games on this thing.  

I experimented with KungFu Flash which was really cool.  I pondered an Ultimate II+.  The problem was, none of them had midi and the Kerberos is impossible to find.  But then -- I found TeensyROM and it had MIDI capability too.  Perfect!

The one thing that all these amazing carts have in common is that they're kind of slow at navigating over thousands of files.  It's a bit overwhelming. Trying to find that one game you played before but having trouble? :)  Call me impatient, but it takes tpo long to explore collections with these carts.  So this project aims to solve that problem. 

I contacted the creator, Mr Travis S, and started brainstorming.  After a lot of hard work, late nights and bugging Travis with crazy ideas, I now offer this UI and hope it finds a place in your retro workflow. Enjoy!
