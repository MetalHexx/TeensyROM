## The Story
I am a late bloomer commodore 64 nerd.  I found a C64 at an auction and thought, hey, maybe I can find a way to control one of these with MIDI to make some music.  I started researching ways to get some games on this thing.  I experimented with KungFu Flash which was really cool.  I pondered an Ultimate II+.  The problem was, none of them had midi and the Kerberos is impossible to find.  But then -- I found TeensyROM and it had MIDI capability too.  Perfect!

The one thing that all these amazing carts have in common is that they're kind of slow at navigating over thousands of files.  It's a bit overwhelming. Then, try finding that game you enjoyed before.  Have fun finding it. :)  Call me impatient, but it takes tpo long to explore collections with these carts.  So this project aims to solve that problem. I contacted the creator, Mr Travis S, and started brainstorming.  After a lot of hard work and late nights, I now offer this UI and hope it helps people with similar goals.  Enjoy!

## Who is this for?
I'd like to think everyone can get some value out of it.  While some may argue that it lacks the charm of a pure C64 experience...sure.  I can't argue with that.  But, there are modern desktop warriors like myself who multi-task a lot and sometimes want a quick experience on the C64 from time to time with zero hassle.  Load the UI, turn on the C64, click the random button and you're playing games or music instantly.  Zero hassle.

For the purists, I challenge you to give it a shot.  It has plenty of utility in the form of file transfers to reduce the SD card juggling act.  Try loading HSVC and let the tunes roll while you do things around the house.
